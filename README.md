# Exploring Basic Distributional Representations

This repository includes a Python Jupyter Notebook which explores basic distributional representations as they are used in NLP. Such representations have over the last decade or so fallen out of favour. They have been largely replace by embeddings created with neural networks. While I don't expect them to make a comeback any time soon, they are still an interesting piece of technology that shows how far we can get with a little bit of statistical linguistics.
